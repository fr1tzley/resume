HOW TO SATISFY EACH THING 

Resume uploads:
Simple HTML frontend with 3 upload buttons. This should call some sort of endpoint that sends the file to the backend
with a POST, featuring some argument indicating what type of data it is 

Extract key information:
Use a combination of OpenAI and spaCy to pull out keywords from the job description and resume. The score can be the number 
that match, plus maybe a subjective element from the AI. 

Generating Scorecard:
Just make a call to the OpenAI API, maybe with a few examples.
